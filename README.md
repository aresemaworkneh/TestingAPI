# API Testing Automation

This project demonstrates automated testing of RESTful APIs using Python and the requests library.

## Description

The project focuses on automating the testing of RESTful APIs using Python. It includes test scripts written in Python that interact with the APIs, send requests, and validate responses. The scripts are designed to cover various scenarios and ensure the APIs are functioning as expected. The project also showcases integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.

## Features

- Automated testing of RESTful APIs
- Support for various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Validation of API responses
- Data-driven testing for different scenarios
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- requests library installed (`pip install requests`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the dependencies:
`pip3 install requests `

### Usage

1. Update the `base_url` variable in the test scripts (`tests.py`) with the base URL of the API you want to test.

2. Run the test scripts
### Test Scenarios

The test scripts included in this project cover the following scenarios:

- Sending GET requests to retrieve data from the API.
- Sending POST requests to create new data via the API.
- Validating API responses for expected status codes and response structures.
- Performing data-driven testing for different scenarios.
